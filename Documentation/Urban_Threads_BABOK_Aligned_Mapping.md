# BABOK Mapping – Urban Threads Business Analyst Project

This document provides a structured mapping between each task within the Urban Threads loyalty program simulation and the corresponding BABOK® (Business Analysis Body of Knowledge) knowledge areas and tasks. This demonstrates how formal business analysis standards have been applied throughout the engagement.
