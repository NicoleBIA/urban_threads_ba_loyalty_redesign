# Urban Threads Loyalty Program Redesign  
### A Business Analysis Simulation for Customer Retention and Conversion Optimization  
**Analyst Project Architecture and Scenario Design Rationale**

---

## 1. Purpose of the Project Simulation

This simulation was created to demonstrate the full lifecycle of a Business Analyst engagement focused on solving a strategic challenge for a fictional e-commerce company. The goal is to showcase business analysis capabilities through a realistic case involving customer retention, loyalty program design, and checkout process optimization.

The project centers on Urban Threads, a mid-sized online clothing retailer experiencing high cart abandonment and declining customer retention. As a Business Analyst, the objective is to elicit, analyze, and document stakeholder requirements for a proposed loyalty solution while uncovering underlying business and process issues.

## 2. Simulation Design Philosophy

This project was intentionally constructed to reflect real-world complexity, ambiguity, and cross-functional friction often encountered in business environments. The scenario was designed based on common e-commerce pain points—abandoned carts, unclear shipping costs, and the demand for repeat customer engagement—paired with known BA patterns from industry literature and frameworks such as BABOK.

The simulation avoids oversimplification and emphasizes the nuances of stakeholder conflict, misalignment of goals, and iterative discovery. It reflects both strategic business concerns and tactical process gaps, offering a complete view of how a BA works within and across teams.

## 3. Stakeholder Persona Strategy

Six stakeholder personas were developed, each grounded in a functional role and layered with communication styles, pain points, biases, and sample dialogue to mirror realistic dynamics. These include:

- Marketing Manager (vague, territorial)
- Customer Experience Lead (customer-centered, pragmatic)
- eCommerce Operations Manager (process-focused, risk-aware)
- UX/Product Owner (design-driven, user-first)
- Data Analyst (quantitative, pattern-focused)
- CFO (executive sponsor, ROI-driven)

Each persona was crafted to reflect typical decision-making tensions within organizations, offering opportunities to simulate interviews, conflicting requirements, and the need to reconcile diverse perspectives.

## 4. Role Assumption Justification

This project is executed from the standpoint of an **external Business Analyst consultant** brought in to assess the loyalty program opportunity and recommend a viable course of action.

This role allows for:
- A formal discovery and requirements elicitation phase
- Clear engagement boundaries and deliverables
- Simulation of access and trust-building challenges
- Emphasis on strategic communication, documentation, and structured recommendation delivery

Simulating an external role also creates natural limitations on access to internal systems or authority, encouraging realistic workarounds and scope control.

---

## 5. Project Toolchain and Deliverables

To reflect typical BA workflows, the following tools were selected:

**Documentation & Requirements**
- Microsoft Word / Google Docs – BRD, interview notes, summaries
- Google Sheets / Excel – Assumptions modeling, prioritization matrices

**Process Visualization**
- Lucidchart / draw.io – Process mapping (As-Is and To-Be), stakeholder maps

**Presentation & Summary**
- Google Slides / PowerPoint – Executive-ready solution deck

**Optional Data Support**
- Excel-based simulations of site behavior, cart flow, and loyalty projections

Key deliverables include:
- Stakeholder Matrix and Persona Sheets
- Process Flow Diagrams
- Business Requirements Document (BRD)
- Executive Recommendation Presentation
- Meta Documentation (`README_Behind_the_Scenario.md`)

---

## 6. Scenario Planning and Elicitation Design

Elicitation challenges were designed to reflect industry realities:
- Stakeholders offer conflicting or vague input
- Some voices are louder or more influential than others
- Risk of scope creep or misaligned expectations exists
- Not all requirements are clear upfront; follow-up and clarification are needed

This creates a layered simulation that emphasizes not just documentation, but critical thinking, facilitation, stakeholder empathy, and iterative discovery—core BA competencies.

## 7. Analyst’s Reflection and Intent

This simulation project serves as a dual-purpose showcase:

1. To present a professional-level business analysis case with stakeholder-facing deliverables and evidence of practical tools and techniques.
2. To offer a transparent, structured window into the **thinking process** behind the simulation itself—scenario design, stakeholder modeling, tool selection, and realism calibration.

It reflects a business analyst mindset grounded in intentionality, scenario planning, and alignment with industry frameworks like BABOK. This documentation is included to help hiring managers and evaluators assess not only what was produced, but **how and why** each element was constructed.
