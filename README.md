# Urban Threads Loyalty Program Redesign  
### A Business Analysis Simulation for Customer Retention and Conversion Optimization

---

## Project Overview

This project simulates a full-scale Business Analyst engagement designed to solve a strategic challenge for Urban Threads, a fictional online clothing retailer. The company is experiencing high cart abandonment rates and low customer retention, prompting the need for a redesigned loyalty program and streamlined checkout experience.

As the Business Analyst, the objective is to elicit stakeholder requirements, map current processes, uncover root causes, and recommend a loyalty program solution that aligns with both customer expectations and operational constraints.

The project showcases a realistic end-to-end BA workflow, including stakeholder engagement, requirements documentation, process modeling, and solution recommendation—aligned with the principles outlined in the BABOK® (Business Analysis Body of Knowledge).

- **Potential Team Members** who want insight into collaborative analysis workflows  
- **Cross-Functional Stakeholders** interested in stakeholder alignment and recommendation logic
